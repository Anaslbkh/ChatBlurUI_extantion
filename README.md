# ChatBlurUI

ChatBlurUI is a privacy-focused browser extension that automatically blurs chat titles in the sidebars of popular AI chat platforms, helping you keep your conversations private from prying eyes. The blur is removed on hover, allowing you to quickly reveal titles when you need them.

## Supported Platforms

- ChatGPT (chat.openai.com, chatgpt.com)
- Gemini (gemini.google.com)
- Claude (claude.ai)

## Features

- **Automatic Blur:** Chat titles in the sidebar are blurred by default for privacy.
- **Reveal on Hover:** Hovering over a title temporarily removes the blur for easy reading.
- **Performance Optimized:** Uses efficient DOM observation and event delegation for smooth operation.
- **Multi-Platform:** Works seamlessly across several major AI chat platforms.

## How It Works

1. The extension injects a small script into supported chat sites.
2. It identifies the sidebar and chat title elements using platform-specific selectors.
3. Titles are blurred using a CSS filter. When you hover over a title, the blur is removed.
4. The extension observes sidebar changes to ensure new chats are always blurred.

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open your browser's extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions/` for Chrome).
3. Enable "Developer mode".
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder.

## Customization

- You can edit the CSS in `content.js` to change the blur strength or transition.
- Add or update platform selectors in `content.js` to support more sites.
